# EC327_ALControl
EC327 Android App Project; ALControl is a way to track your BAC dynamically while out for a night of drinking!


ALControl can be easily used by installing the packaged APK. All a user needs to do is create their profile based on gender and weight.
It is as simple as selecting your drink type (beer, wine, liquor) and tapping a button every time you finish a drink. Your BAC is then printed
and displayed as a progress/warning bar. Remember anything above 0.08% is unsafe for vehicle operation.



This app is targeted for android API 28, meaning it works best on a Pixel 2XL running the latest release of Android (Android 9 at time of release).

**This app has not been uploaded to the Google Play Store, and no unnecessary permissions are requested.**
