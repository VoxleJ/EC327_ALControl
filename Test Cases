Test Cases:

Test 1: User closes app while drinking--> BAC is persistent and will still be calculated when adding drinks.
Test 2: User spams add drink--> BAC is still calculated and persistent pressing should not crash the app.
Test 3: User presses back button to switch drink type--> Drink type may not change; checked changing drink type by parsing the 
        data file
Test 4: End Session does not end session--> Hit end session, check if BAC is still displayed/add drink and see if BAC is 
        still increasing from the last known value
Test 5: Horizontal View-->Unfortunately Landscape View is not supported in this version.
Test 6: Accurate BAC calculations compared to the initial formula--> compute seconds elapsed and do by hand; from internal 
        testing it seems to work properly
Test 7: User exits without ending session--> App will still calculate BAC from last drink; generally should not be an issue 
        as the BAC calculation also incorporates time however the user may need to end session before inputting a 
        different drink type.
Test 8: Constantly open and reopen app--> User is greeted with welcome page each time, requiring an ever updating profile; this can be
        Interpreted as a feature as weight can fluctuate quite rapidly in our market (College Students), so this could be an 
        easy way to update profiles.
